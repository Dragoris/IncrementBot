# incrementbot

Incrementbot is a chat bot built on the Hubot framework. It allows teams to give and take away imaginary internet points from team members and post the current standings in chat. When you give someone a point IncrementBot also gives them a randomly generated complemets as well!

Points are given out with the command format: @someone ++ Optional Message to send.
using -- instead of ++ will take away a point instead.

Typing "scoreboard" in chat will display the current standings for all to see.
